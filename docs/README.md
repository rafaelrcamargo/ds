# ðŸ“Š `ds` - Useful stats on your terminal</h1>

*It's like "docker stats" but with beautiful, real-time charts directly in your terminal.*

![ds](./assets/demo.png)

## Why?

Lately I've been trying out [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) - OrbStack is the fast, light, and easy way to run Docker containers and Linux. Develop at lightspeed with our Docker Desktop alternative.

And as much as I love the idea of OrbStack, I really miss the charts that **Docker Desktop** provides. This is a issue that's on the OrbStack team's radar, but I wanted to see if I could come up with a solution in the meantime.

I also think having a visual reference when analyzing your system can be very helpful. Colors and moving things can help you spot issues that you might not otherwise notice. And that's how this project was born.

## Installation

### Source

For this you'll need to have [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed. From there, you can clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelrcamargo/ds
```

Then just `cd` into the directory and run:

```bash
cargo run # For development
cargo build --release # For production
```

To add this command to your `$PATH`, you can run:

```bash
# Will probably need sudo
mv target/release/ds /usr/local/bin
```

> **Note**: Yes, I do plan on adding this to crates.io, but I want to make sure it's stable enough before I do that.

## Usage

To use it with the default settings, just run:

```bash
ds
```

For more options, you can run:

```bash
ds -h

# Think "docker stats" but with beautiful, real-time charts. ðŸ“Š
#
# Usage: ds [OPTIONS] [CONTAINER]...
#
# Arguments:
#   [CONTAINER]...  The container to show stats for.
#
# Options:
#   -c, --compact  Enable a simpler, more compact view.
#   -f, --full     Enable a more detailed view.
#   -h, --help     Print help
```

### Examples & Use Cases

Some examples of how you can use this tool.

#### Compact view for all containers

This can be useful if you want to see basic info about all your containers, in a compact view (Saving space for other things).

```bash
ds -c
```

#### Full view for some containers

This is useful if you want to see the stats for a specific container. This will include NET and IO charts.

```bash
ds -f 5f03528a8fbe thing-api-1-1
```

## Pain Points

Some things that are bad, but expected.

<details open>
<summary>

### Painfully slow to start

</summary>

I know... It is slow to start, but that's it. This is the time `docker stats` takes to run, it has to hook up to the container and get the realtime stats. As for today I have tested it with OrbStack and Docker Desktop, the delay seems to be the same, but I'll keep looking into it.

### `network_mode: host`

</summary>

From the GIF you can also note that the `NET` chart is not moving, but this is expected there. This containers are running in `network_mode: host` and the `NET` chart will only be populated if you're using the `bridge` network.

> Ps: If you use Mac and think I'm completely out of my mind for the `network_mode: host` above, I know. It's a running topic on the Desktop for Mac and yet not supported. You can follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/238). And this was the main reason I started looking into OrbStack.
